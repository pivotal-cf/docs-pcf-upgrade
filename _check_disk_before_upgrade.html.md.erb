Confirm that you have adequate disk space for your upgrades. You need at least 20&nbsp;GB of free disk space to upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. If you plan to upgrade other products, the amount of disk space required depends on how many tiles you plan to deploy to your upgraded <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

To check current persistent disk usage:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select the **Status** tab and check the value of the `PERS. DISK` column. If persistent disk usage is higher than 50%:
  1. Select **Resource Config**.
  1. Increase your persistent disk space to handle the size of the resources. If you do not know how much disk space to allocate, set the value to at least 100&nbsp;GB.
